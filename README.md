# GRVI
Geiger's Ruby Variant Implementation

A FLOSS implementation of the Ruby interpreter with backwards compatibility with the Ruby 1.8 interpreter in C for a project I'm working on. Aims for minimalism, may have accuracy issues, and is mostly tailored for use with mkxp. Please do not use unless you understand that there may be deviationa from Ruby standards. Not recommended for use in commercial projects and all liability for use or misuse of this software is on the user. Caveat emptor.
